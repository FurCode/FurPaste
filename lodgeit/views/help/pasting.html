  <h3>Creating New Pastes</h3>
  <p>
    If you use the web interface to create new pastes the process is
    straightforward. All you have to do is to click on the <a href="/">new</a>
    tab and fill in the text field. Additionally you should select a proper
    highlighter from the list below to make it easier to read your paste.

  <p>
    After you have finished just hit "paste" to submit the paste.
  </p>
  <h3>Replying to Pastes</h3>
  <p>
    Another way of creating a new paste is to reply to an existing paste.
    When looking at a paste click on the "Paste Details" link to open the
    paste menu. From there select the "reply to this paste" link.
  </p>

  <p>
    A new editor window will open with the contents of the old paste. Just
    do your changes and click "paste" to submit them.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you use the reply feature a link to the parent paste is created
    automatically. This allows you to compare those two pastes with one
    click to find changes easily. For information about the diff view
    head over to the <a href="/help/advanced/">advanced features</a> page.
